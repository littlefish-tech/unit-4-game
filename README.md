# unit-4-game

#### This is a challenge project, but as long as work step by step, I will find the final solution
- The very first step, I need to do the basic styling of the webpage, make sure I put all elements where I want them to be.
- The second, I will need to put content in each of the element.
- Next I want the computer to pick a random number each time we win/loss/refresh the game
- I find 4 nice diamonds pictures and I assigned values to those diamond.
- Each time when user click the diamond, the total score will be going up by adding the new value
- when the user get the computer number, they win.
- If the user goes over the computer number, they loss.

#### Technology I use:
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
